# StackQueueLinkedlist
StackQueueLinkedlist in C++
Linked List and Queue and Stack Implementation
This repository contains C code that demonstrates the implementation of a singly linked list, a queue, and a stack. The program provides various operations to manipulate these data structures.

#Usage
After running the program, you will be presented with a menu where you can choose different operations on the linked list, queue, and stack:

Create: Creates a new linked list by adding elements to it.
Insert at the end: Inserts an element at the end of the linked list.
Insert at specified position: Inserts an element at a specified position in the linked list.
Delete from the end: Deletes the last element from the linked list.
Delete from specified position: Deletes an element from a specified position in the linked list.
Exit: Quits the program.
Follow the prompts on the screen to input your choices and interact with the linked list.

Additionally, the program provides operations for a queue:

Insert: Inserts an element into the queue.
Delete: Deletes an element from the queue.
And for a stack:

Insert: Inserts an element into the stack.
Delete: Deletes an element from the stack.
Follow the prompts on the screen to input your choices and interact with the queue and stack.
